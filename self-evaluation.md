# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  * I feel less confident with the each method, and am definitely going to review it further.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  * It felt good blending my knowledge from earlier lessons in Mod 0 with what was learned in this method. I did have some unproductive struggle and then realized I was putting a single = instead of == during challenge 2.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
   * I need to review how different methods can work within the each method. I may need to adjust my calendar to do this or may review it during in-between time of mod 0 and 1.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * Can all other methods work within the each method? I will test out code that I write to see how other methods interact with the each method.
